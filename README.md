# PyTorch-reveal.js
This repository contains reveal.js slides for a Deep Learning newbie's introduction to [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).
I designed it for the undergraduate students at the Department of Mechatronics and Control Engineering, [University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore](https://uet.edu.pk).
Head over to the [website](https://stalhabukhari.github.io/PyTorch-reveal.js/) and let me know if there's anything fishy.
